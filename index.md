My mom was my favorite and still is, as a kid there were times I thought my father did not like me. My sister being the doll she is, was his favorite. I always felt she got more privileges’ than me. Be it toys, chocolates, clothes I was always the one to sacrifice. So naturally I had no love towards my dad as I did for my mom.<br>

My dad was hardworking, dedicated to his profession, a street smart and unquestionably charming. He came to city with no money and stayed in one of his school’s classroom surviving on one same meal a day - today lot of men will not eat food if the masala is wrong. <br>

As a boy I was none of this and all those people who knew my father were disappointed in seeing me as his son. No matter what I tried he was a little too much for me to scale up to. This was the reason I never wanted to be with him and chose to spend most of my time with mom. But things changed, it was no big bang but it happened gradually. It was only when I reflected several years back I was able to understand how we both transformed into completely different men from what we were.<br>

Read few excerpts from my inspiration collection [Common struggles of an uncommon man](incidents.html).

Incidents like these are many and so many more to come. Without me knowing I had started loving my father. I feel sad when he asks me to do something as opposed to the hard orders he used to put through. I can take someone disrespecting me but my father and mother no matter how many they are or how big they be, I will retaliate. Me myself being a father now I realize how a father should be. Parents will have a slight inclination towards one kid, in our case my mom favored me and dad my sister. Its just a preference but have never been partial in anyway.<br>

The entire world would accept that Mother is an epitome of love as it is shown in every aspect of one’s life. But the love a father show’s is always hidden behind those same aspects. <br>

Last but not the least, <b><i>A father may look like he is a Master but in reality, has, is and will always be his children’s Servant.</i></b> <br>

With Love, <br>
