Read my thoughts [Common struggles of an uncommon man](https://github.com/Intellections/PersonalBook/blob/gh-pages/Incidents.md).

My mom was my favorite and still is, as a kid there were times I thought my father did not like me. My sister being the doll she is, was his favorite. I always felt she got more privileges’ than me. Be it toys, chocolates, clothes I was always the one to sacrifice. So naturally I had no love towards my dad as I did for my mom.<br>

My dad was hardworking, dedicated to his profession, a street smart and unquestionably charming. He came to city with no money and stayed in one of his school’s classroom surviving on one same meal a day - today lot of men will not eat food if the masala is wrong. <br>

As a boy I was none of this and all those people who knew my father were disappointed in seeing me as his son. No matter what I tried he was a little too much for me to scale up to. This was the reason I never wanted to be with him and chose to spend most of my time with mom. But things changed, it was no big bang but it happened gradually. It was only when I reflected several years back I was able to understand how we both transformed into completely different men from what we were. Read below few incidents.<br>

<b>Father’s first success comes at his son’s first failure:</b><br>

In my first job I had developed a POC but on the previous day of demo it stopped working, I slogged all night and with no hope I returned one of many calls dad had made. With limited understanding of what I was saying he said; <i>"If this does not work, it’s not end of the world"</i> giving a small pause for me to pull my confidence, he continued, <i>"If it is still not working, you have not tried everything"</i> and he disconnected the call. The POC worked and demo did not happen – details some other time.<br>

<b>Show respect to elders, particularly if they are fools:</b><br>

Second incident is when my father asked me to take blessing of a relative who had insulted him during a ritual. Being young blood, I refused to do that, but my dad forced me. Later that evening the same relative came and told me, “I am not very fond of your father, but I am glad you are grow up just like him” and returned hiding his guilt. <br>

<b>Winning a situation is much bigger than winning an argument:</b><br>

At a marriage proposal, bride’s father disrespected my father, if it were anybody else that would have been a heated argument. But my father asked a simple question very politely and won the hearts of bride’s relatives. Also in the same wedding bride’s father threw tantrums when specific Item was not severed in breakfast but at his place for dinner when they served bad food unknowingly, my father calmly called them and whispered asking them not to serve that dish anymore.<br>

<b>Charm is unmissable:</b><br>

While traveling to Paris, I had to face some hard questions during immigration as my passport was drenched. My father had similar problem so I feared how he will be able to handle it. But I saw him laughing along with the immigration officer and later told me they belong to same village which is in fact 50 kms apart. Similar incident happened where he got milk from a KFC store on the next morning of him landing in Paris with no money or understanding of the language.<br>
<br>

Incidents like these are many and so many more to come. Without me knowing I had started loving my father. I feel sad when he asks me to do something as opposed to the hard orders he used to put through. I can take someone disrespecting me but my father and mother no matter how many they are or how big they be, I will retaliate. Me myself being a father now I realize how a father should be. Parents will have a slight inclination towards one kid, in our case my mom favored me and dad my sister. Its just a preference but have never been partial in anyway.<br>

The entire world would accept that Mother is an epitome of love as it is shown in every aspect of one’s life. But the love a father show’s is always hidden behind those same aspects. <br>

Last but not the least, <b><i>A father may look like he is a Master but in reality, has, is and will always be his children’s Servant.</i></b> <br>

With Love, <br>
