My mom was my favorite and still is, as a kid there were times I thought my father did not like me. My sister being the doll she is, was his favorite which made me feel she got more privileges’ than me. Be it toys, chocolates, clothes I was always the one to sacrifice. Every parent will have a slight inclination towards a kid, in my case Mom favored me and Dad, my sister. Its just a preference but they have never been partial in anyway.<br>

The entire world would accept, <i> Mother stands as an epitome of love as it is shown in every aspect of one’s life, but the love a father show’s is always hidden behind those same aspects and goes un-noticed. <br>

My dad, Venugopalachari was hardworking, dedicated in his profession, a street smart and unquestionably charming. He came to city with no money in hand and spent several days staying in a classroom of the school he used to work for Rs.150 while surviving on one same meal a day - today lot of men will not even eat thier food if the masala is wrong. <br>

As a boy I was none of this and all those people who knew my father were disappointed in seeing me as his son. No matter what I tried he was a little too much for me to scale up to. Naturally i chose to spend most of my time with mom, but things changed gradually. It began at my preparation for my group discussion where the trainer asked me who was my inspiration, I was an adrent fan of cricketer, movie, wrestling and tennis stars but not a single person had an inspiring impact on me, it was that moment it reflected what my father meant to me as i realised the impact he had on me.<br>

Read excerpts from my writeup collection for few incidents, the collection shared here is just in starts as i get time will complete it. [Common struggles of an uncommon man](Incidents.md).

Incidents like these are many and so many more to come. Without me knowing I had leaned towards my father, started feeling emotion on his actions. I felt happy when he scolded me and felt sad when he asks me to do something as opposed to the hard orders usually put through. Started becoming protective about him, I would brush off any disrespect to me but to my parents I would retaliate with no hesitation irrespective of who. He had become a friend to me and without even knowing our roles had reversed. With this lockdown imposed i have become the father and he my child. I may be in few peoples red eyes because of him to not attend any functions or by having private funtions without inviting others. It was important for me to care for my father and kids not worrying about feelings. People who know me would anyway understand. Celebrating his birthday with his siblings and my family was one of the fun event every year, but this time it can't be that way. I felt his way of life might inspire few as it did for me.<br>

Last but not the least, <b><i>A father may look like he is a Master but in reality, has, is and will always be his child’s Servant.</i></b> <br>

With Love, <br>
