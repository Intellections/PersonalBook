<b>Father’s first success comes at his son’s first failure:</b><br>

In my first job I had developed a POC but on the previous day of demo it stopped working, I slogged all night and with no hope I returned one of many calls dad had made. With limited understanding of what I was saying he said; <i>"If this does not work, it’s not end of the world"</i> giving a small pause for me to pull my confidence, he continued, <i>"If it is still not working, you have not tried everything"</i> and he disconnected the call. The POC worked and demo did not happen – details some other time.<br>

<b>Show respect to elders, particularly if they are fools:</b><br>

Second incident is when my father asked me to take blessing of a relative who had insulted him during a ritual. Being young blood, I refused to do that, but my dad forced me. Later that evening the same relative came and told me, “I am not very fond of your father, but I am glad you are grow up just like him” and returned hiding his guilt. <br>

<b>Winning a situation is much bigger than winning an argument:</b><br>

At a marriage proposal, bride’s father disrespected my father, if it were anybody else that would have been a heated argument. But my father asked a simple question very politely and won the hearts of bride’s relatives. Also in the same wedding bride’s father threw tantrums when specific Item was not severed in breakfast but at his place for dinner when they served bad food unknowingly, my father calmly called them and whispered asking them not to serve that dish anymore.<br>

<b>Charm is unmissable:</b><br>

While traveling to Paris, I had to face some hard questions during immigration as my passport was drenched. My father had similar problem so I feared how he will be able to handle it. But I saw him laughing along with the immigration officer and later told me they belong to same village which is in fact 50 kms apart. Similar incident happened where he got milk from a KFC store on the next morning of him landing in Paris with no money or understanding of the language.<br>
